This repository allows to change the time of the srt files (subtitles) so it can be modify accordingly to the video file possesed.

To run this code, the original file to modify must have the name "sub.srt" or change its name inside the code. And the time to add or substract has to be indicated in the code too, it's commented so it shouldn't be a problem.
